![Dashboard Screenshot](screenshots/dashboard.png)

This repository contains an interactive dashboard for visualizing global conflict data, developed as part of a Bachelor Thesis in 2022. The dashboard is built with Plotly Dash in Python and provides insights into worldwide conflicts, their types, and their correlation with economic indicators and Google Trends.

## Project Description

The Global Conflicts Data Dashboard offers a comprehensive visualization of conflict data across the globe. It includes various interactive elements to explore the types of conflicts, their distribution over the years, and their relationship with economic indicators in G8+5 countries.

## Features

- **Worldwide Conflicts Visualization**: Interactive map showing the distribution and types of conflicts over the years.
- **Conflict Type vs. Economy**: Comparative analysis of conflict types against GDP growth in G8+5 countries.
- **Google Trends Analysis**: Insights into Google search trends related to various conflict types over time.
- **Interactive Filters**: Dynamic selection of countries, KPIs and conflict types for tailored visualizations.
